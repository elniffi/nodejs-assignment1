## Homework Assignment #1

Please create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 

2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format.

**NOTE: I interpreted the word "posts" in 2. as that it should only respond to post requests.**
